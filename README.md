 ## Our Story
 We decided on a health tracking website developed by our four dedicated individuals. We wanted a website to assist people who are beginning their healthy life journey to have an intuitive page and app to calculate their daily caloric intake, look for fantastic and healthy foods, and set up an exercise all on one page.
 Finally the application is a receipe finder app, with videos help to cook your delicious food.
